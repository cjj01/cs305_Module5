Module_5 Practicing GitHub Project Management 

I want to create a app that tracks how many hours you are at the library. For each hour that you study for a test, a virtal pet is feed. It it a virtal study pet that will make students want to study. One must log into the app to log hours. The hours can be then converted to money to spend on it virtal pet.
